# About project
Part of my Machine Learning journey. 
My implementation of Random Forest with NBC and ID3 classifiers. ID3 classifier is taken and change from other repository (link on the top of the code). 

The whole point of a project was to implement required algorithms and also to prepare the scripts for experiments. 

# Selecting Research/Experiments to run:
To initiate research, configure the main.py file accordingly. Provide a single or a queue of experiments that you wish to conduct. For each experiment, input a string corresponding to the respective dataset in the argument. 

The available options are:

    'corona' -> corona.csv
    'divorce' -> divorce.csv
    'glass' -> glass.csv
    'letter' -> letter-recognition.csv
    'loan_approval' -> loan_approval.csv

# Required modules:
    scikit-learn
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    openpyxl

# Running program from the /code directory:
    python main.py
