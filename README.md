# About project
Part of my Machine Learning journey. 
My implementation of Random Forest with NBC and ID3 classifiers. ID3 classifier is taken and change from other repository (link on the top of the code). 

The whole point of a project was to implement required algorithms and also to prepare the scripts for experiments.
